# Abstract:

Our project uses a Covid-19 dataset that contains over 1 million unique patients and 21 columns. Some of the main features of this
dataset set consist of patient type, age, pneumonia, COPD, diabetes, and more. First, we verified whether the data was clean and
generated charts to view the distribution of each of the features in the dataset to look for imbalances. We did have to generate a
new column to provide a binary classification for whether a patient had died from Covid-19. The main goal of this project is to
take this dataset and determine whether a patient is at risk given their current symptom, status, and medical history. This
approach also enables the exploration of potential correlations between specific health conditions and COVID-19 outcomes, paving 
the way for personalized medical interventions.

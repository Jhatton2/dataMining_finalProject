Final group project DataMining
Jesse - I added three datasets to consider. 

The first is Uniform Crime Reporting Program Data: Supplementary Homicide Reports, United States, 2022. there are several things we could do here, such as a review of gun homicides or the types of weapons used in homicide.

The next is Personal Consumption expenditures from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, BEA.gov.  This one could be very challenging based on how the data is prepared in the dataset.

The last is a data science jobs report, which will likely be too small a dataset to create an appropriate report.

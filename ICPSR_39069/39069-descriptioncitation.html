								<div><strong>Alternate Title:</strong> <p>UCR Supplementary Homicide Reports, 2022</p></div>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA: SUPPLEMENTARY HOMICIDE REPORTS, 2022 (SHR) provide detailed information on criminal homicides reported to the police. These homicides consist of murders; non-negligent killings also called non-negligent manslaughter; and justifiable homicides. UCR Program contributors compile and submit their crime data by one of two means: either directly to the FBI or through their State UCR Programs. State UCR Programs frequently impose mandatory reporting requirements which have been effective in increasing both the number of reporting agencies as well as the number and accuracy of each participating agency's reports. Each agency may be identified by its numeric state code, alpha-numeric agency ("ORI") code, jurisdiction population, and population group. In addition, each homicide incident is identified by month of occurrence and situation type, allowing flexibility in creating aggregations and subsets.</span></p>

								<div><strong>Data Collection Notes:</strong> <p>Starting with the year 1998, each of the four parts of the UCR data collection archived by ICPSR is released as a separate study under its own study number. The Supplementary Homicide Reports data for the years 1975-1997 can be found in UNIFORM CRIME REPORTING PROGRAM DATA: 1975-1997 (<a href="https://doi.org/10.3886/ICPSR09028">ICPSR 9028</a>)., This data collection was produced by the United States Department of Justice, Federal Bureau of Investigation., The unit of analysis in this dataset is the homicide "incident" as defined by the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program. Thus, information on the victim(s), the offender(s), the relationship between these individuals, the weapons used, and the circumstances surrounding the homicide are provided by incident. Up to eleven offenders can be involved in an incident. The Uniform Crime Reporting Program (UCR) is a data collection effort designed to provide an overall view of crime in the United States. Data for the UCR have been gathered by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) since 1930. The data are compiled from law enforcement agencies on a monthly basis. UCR data housed at the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) include: OFFENSES KNOWN AND CLEARANCES BY ARREST (also know as RETURN A), PROPERTY STOLEN AND RECOVERED (also known as SUPPLEMENT TO RETURN A), SUPPLEMENTARY HOMICIDE REPORTS (SHR), and POLICE EMPLOYEE (LEOKA) DATA. The UCR data for 1975-1997 are archived under ICPSR study number 9028. Starting with the 1998 UCR data each of the main data files comprising the UCR has been given its own ICPSR study number. New study numbers will be issued each year for OFFENSES KNOWN AND CLEARANCES BY ARREST, PROPERTY STOLEN AND RECOVERED, SUPPLEMENTAL HOMICIDE REPORTS, and POLICE EMPLOYEE (LEOKA) DATA. Each UCR data file, regardless of study number, has its own documentation specific to it., These studies are 'static data snapshots' of the data available on the FBI website via the <a href="https://cde.ucr.cjis.gov">Crime Data Explorer</a>, which is continuously updated.

ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></p></div>
